# Introduction
I'm a software developer who thrives on creating new and innovative projects. My primary specialization is in Java, but I am also proficient in PHP, C++, C#, Kotlin, Node.js, JavaScript, and TypeScript. My journey began with developing plugins for Minecraft Bedrock, which sparked my passion for software development.

Now, I find great joy in working within the realm of DevOps and game development. I create addons and plugins for Minecraft Bedrock, plugins for Minecraft Java, and mods. Additionally, I develop REST APIs and design websites. While Minecraft remains a significant focus, I also enjoy branching out to experiment with projects beyond the Minecraft universe.

I'm a strong advocate for open source and love contributing to and collaborating on open-source projects. This community-driven approach allows me to continuously learn, share knowledge, and innovate within the tech space.
